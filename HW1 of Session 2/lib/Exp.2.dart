2. Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart

Answer:

The difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart is as follows:

var: allows you to declare different-type variables. It's considered as a KEYWORD not a data type, 
as well as it's type is known from the value assigned to it at runtime.

dynamic: is used to declare a variable whose type is not known at compile-time. Dynamic can be used 
when you don't know the type of the variable. It's cosidered as a weak data type and like var, it's type is known from the value assigned to it.

Explicitly typed variables: like int, double, String
are used to declare a variable whose type is known at compile-time. 
It's considered as a strong data type and it's type is known from direct declaration.
